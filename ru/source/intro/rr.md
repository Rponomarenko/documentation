# Relative returns

## Basic information

The investment portfolio is redistributed according to the algorithm once a day (the exchange has 252 working days a year). Redistribution occurs at the beginning of the day. For our platform, we assume that the purchase of shares occurs at the open price.

Equity grows with the correct prediction of price changes. The daily change in equity is estimated after the end of the trading day and strongly depends on the close price. Close is the price at which a security last trades on a trading day.

Algorithm results, calculated on historical data, are usually presented on an equity graph in order to understand the behavior of the cumulative profit (Fig.1). In our platform, we set initial equity to 1, so it can be scaled easily.
