# Submissions

While your strategy is being tested, 
it is located on the “On Verification” tab. 
All strategies that do not meet the criteria appear on the “Filtered” tab. 
This means that the strategy does not meet any or several criteria. 
In this tab, you can also find out why the strategy was not accepted to participate by reading the service messages. 
If your strategy meets all the criteria, 
it will appear on the Active tab, where you can see the statistical metrics in real time, including the Sharpe Ratio criterion. It is used to rank all strategies and determines the place in the competition.
