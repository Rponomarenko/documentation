QuantNet is a network of data scientists developing trading algorithms for global financial markets. We create a full-fledged ecosystem for anyone who wants to improve her/his skills and become a professional Quant. We provide for free educational material, data, a full research environment and a development framework where you can test your ideas.

We hold competitions of quantitative trading algorithms with a quarterly prize pool of 500 000 RUB. Each trading algorithm which is submitted to the QuantNet platform is automatically checked, scored, ranked and deemed as eligible for a prize.
