A good way to diversify risks is to increase the number of instruments in the investment portfolio. After that we can set a maximum stock weight to 0.1. It means that we will allocate no more than 10% of our equity to the each stock.

There are many such news every year - they merge with the information noise and we forget them. However, they are reflected in historical data and strongly affect profit in the future.
